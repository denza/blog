	<h1>About Me</h1>

	I am a software developer. The most of time I had work on .NET based technologies and Windows platform. I did not want to be marked by one specific technology and platform, so I took projects that allowed me to challenge diffrent and others.
	<br /><br />
	I worked with many technologies and platforms, do to idea I could learn and expand only from the people who think and work different than I do.
